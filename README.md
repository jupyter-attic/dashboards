## Overview

The dashboards layout extension is an add-on for Jupyter Notebook. It lets you
arrange your notebook outputs (text, plots, widgets, ...) in grid- or
report-like layouts. It saves information about your layouts in your notebook
document. Other people with the extension can open your notebook and view your
layouts.
