Jupyter Dashboards Layout Extension
===================================

The dashboards layout extension is an add-on for Jupyter Notebook. It lets you arrange your notebook outputs (text, plots, widgets, ...) in grid- or report-like layouts. It saves information about your layouts in your notebook document. Other people with the extension can open your notebook and view your layouts.

The extension is part of the larger Jupyter Dashboards effort which covers:

1. Arranging notebook outputs in a grid- or report-like layout 
2. Bundling notebooks and associated assets for deployment as dashboards 
3. Serving notebook-defined dashboards as standalone web apps

The layout extension focuses on (1) above, while `jupyter-incubator/dashboards_bundlers <https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/dashboards_bundlers>`_ handles (2) and `jupyter-incubator/dashboards_server <https://github.com/jupyter-incubator/dashboards_server>`_ implements (3).

For a sample of what's possible with the dashboard layout extension, have a look at the `demo dashboard-notebooks in the project repository <https://github.com/jupyter/dashboards/tree/master/etc/notebooks>`__.
